# E01 — Video chain (State 7)

**Method (director):** seamless start→end-frame clips, `start_image` = beat N keyframe, `end_image` =
beat N+1 keyframe → each clip morphs one locked frame into the next, chained into one flow. **Sound ON.**
720p first pass; upscale at State 9. One clip at a time · `get_cost` + LEDGER row + `vqa.py` endpoint QA
+ face-audit each.

**MODEL = Kling v3.0** (`kling3_0`, std, sound on). Chosen after A/B: seedance_2_0 drifts the END frame
(K1→K2 last-vs-K2 ncc −0.10 ✗); **Kling hard-locks BOTH endpoints** (first 0.99 ✓, last 0.965 ✓) and
costs ~10 cr vs 22.5. Gemini Omni Flash has no start/end roles (can't do endpoint morphs). Per clip:
author the LOGICAL motion + camera that carries frame N→N+1 (lesson V8), Kling prompt order
Scene→Characters→Action→Camera→Audio.

C1 K1→K2 · C2 K2→K12 · C3 K12→K3 · C4 K3→K11 · C5 K11→K13 · C6 K13→K14 · C7 K14→K8 ·

C15 K7→K5 (flash between) · C16 K5→K5 (settle hold, optional / subtle drift).

## QA (per clip, before accept) — `tools/vqa.py` (OpenCV)
first frame ≈ start keyframe (ncc>0.8), last frame ≈ end keyframe (ncc>0.8), glitch spike_ratio<6,
mid-frames free of unwanted morphing. Endpoint preservation is the join-critical check.

## PHASE 1 — site assembly (State 8, locked 2026-07-09)
The site is **video-scrubbed**: the phase-1 film (C1→C6 concatenated, 30.29s @24fps, K1→K2→K12→
K3→K11→K13→K14) IS the scroll. Scroll scrubs the playhead; the clip morphs are the scene changes
(no cuts/wipes inside the take). Assets in `site/public/hero/`: `phase1.mp4` (source, sound on),
`phase1-scrub.mp4` (H.264 dense-keyframe `-g4`, silent, Safari), `phase1-scrub.webm` (VP9 `-g4`,
silent, Chromium/FF — also the only one this env's headless Chromium can decode for capture).
Re-encodes are LOCAL (imageio-ffmpeg), **zero credits**.

**Pacing (director rule: "tailor how many seconds between those frames, then tailor the length"):**
each frame-pair is a fixed ~5.05s of film, but its DWELL in the scroll is tailored per beat and the
page length = Σ(weights). Calm/reveal beats linger, action beats snap past (EDITING-SOUND §10).
Scroll weights (`src/hero.js` SPANS): title 1.1 · C1 shatter 0.9 · note 0.7 · C2 0.7 ·
**Agustín I 1.5** · C3 action 0.6·0.7 · **Najoua II 1.5** · C5 0.8 · charge 0.6 · C6 throw 0.8 ·
**CTA 1.6**. Σ=12.2 → `#hero-sec` height = 12.2×78 ≈ 950vh. Reveals/CTA get the most scroll; action
the least. Extend for phase 2 by appending clips + SPANS rows (holds for reveals, plays for motion).

- **V12 (camera↔action sync) applied from C4 on** [hypothesis]: bind camera to action ("as he acts the
  camera tracks WITH him"), not a separate move. Sync-feel is a VISUAL check (metrics can't measure it).
- _raw clips tracked by job id, not committed to git (heavy); assembled at picture-lock._
- _method: Kling std, motion-only prompt (V11), action-primary (V10), all-objects-move (V9),
  camera↔action synced (V12), axis held (DIRECTING §C), QA every clip (vqa.py + frozen.py)._
- **PROCESS RULE (corrected 2026-07-09): ONE clip at a time.** Generate one → QA → deliver → WAIT for
  the director's go → next. NO parallel batching (GOVERNANCE §10). C4/C5/C6 were wrongly batched;
  they'll be QA'd one-by-one, and no further clip starts without director approval.
- **PROCESS RULE (new, 2026-07-09): STORY-FIRST, decided TOGETHER.** Before generating each clip,
  SHOW the director the first and last frame (start + end keyframe) and agree the in-between story
  (what connects to what, camera move, beat order) collaboratively. Only generate once the director
  has signed off on the story. This gate sits ahead of the get_cost/LEDGER/prompt steps. Rationale:
  the endpoints are locked, so the audience/director narrate the in-between; align on it first.

All sixteen clips locked: C1–C6 (phase-1, K1→K2→K12→K3→K11→K13→K14) + C7 K14→K8 · C8 K8→K6 · C9
K6→K15 · C10 K15→K9 · C11 K9→K4 · C12b K4→BAVER · C13b BAVER→K10 · C14(A) K10→K7 · C15b K7→K5 (8s)

one-at-a-time under the story-first rule. Next: assemble the phase-2 continuation film into the site
(+ new fragment routes: Federica/Başak/Baver/Yaşar), then the Higgsfield app (contest, closes Jul 22).

## PHASE 2 — site assembly (2026-07-09)
The site is now ONE continuous scroll-scrub in two phases. Phase-2 clips C7–C16 were concatenated
(local imageio-ffmpeg, zero credits; normalized 1280×720@24, silent) into `site/public/hero/`:
`phase2-scrub.webm` (VP9 `-g4`, dense keyframes for scrub), `phase2-scrub.mp4` (H.264 `-g4`, Safari),
`phase2.mp4` (source). 53.46s / 1283 frames.
- **Second pinned section `#reel-sec`** with its own `film2`; it crossfades in at the SHARED seam
  frame (phase-1 ends on K14, phase-2 opens on K14 → invisible join). Linear scrub, ~26.5vh/s to
  match phase-1's cadence. The phase-1 CTA moved to the true finale (over the calm K5 at ~50s).
- **Four new fragments reveal at their on-screen motif moment** (the object-timing rule): Federica
  **III** — lapis pendant (K8, ~5s); Başak **IV** — blue nazar (K9, ~20s); Baver **V** — green data
  in the glass (BAVER, ~30s); Yaşar Efe **VI** — Big-Dipper constellation (K10, ~34.6s). With
  Agustín I + Najoua II that completes "Six were witnessed." Loglines are the locked HERO-BIBLE lines
  (Federica's em dash removed per the no-em-dash rule). Routes → `curatedchaos…/fragments/{federica,
  basak,baver,yasar-efe}`.
- **Mobile (≤720px): text + glass box only** — no cutout, ghost numeral, or connector (existing CSS).
  Desktop keeps the cutouts for Federica/Baver/Yaşar. **Başak is text+glass on desktop too** because
  her only source art is a full poster (title + logo + sky), not a clean cutout; her nazar motif on
  screen carries the reveal. TODO: swap in a proper Başak cutout when the upload path is available.
- Verified headless (Playwright + Chromium, range-capable server) at each reveal frame, desktop +
  mobile; phase-1 unchanged (connector/ring/tag intact), no JS errors. Re-encodes are LOCAL (0 cr).

## PHASE 2b — redesign: photo-free fragments + play-through + Adobe fonts (2026-07-09)
Director notes: drop the character photos; every fragment is the film's OWN object → a leader line to a
glass info-box in the negative space; phase-2 froze + looked bad; switch fonts to an Adobe pairing.
- **Freeze fixed.** Root cause: scrubbing a long VP9 by seeking `currentTime` stalls whenever the seek
  lands past the buffered range (VP9 seeks poorly; long scrub needs `-g1`/image-sequence). Phase-2 is
  now a PLAY-THROUGH reel (`film2` plays on enter, no seeking) → no stall. Phase-1 still scrubs.
- **Quality fixed.** Re-encoded phase-2 with a normal GOP (no dense-keyframe tax) at higher quality:
  `phase2.mp4` (H.264 crf20) + `phase2.webm` (VP9 crf28), local imageio-ffmpeg, 0 cr. Visibly crisper.
- **Fragments = object→box annotation (no photos).** For all six: a marker ring rides the film object
  (record · lotus · pendant · nazar · data · constellation), a leader line runs to a frosted glass
  info-box in the negative space, and the box opens as the object comes into focus. Object anchor +
  box position are precomputed (`site/src/fragmap.json`) with a saliency / free-space pass (external-
  labeling technique, Bekos et al.) and the anchor is TRACKED across the reveal so the line follows the
  object. Screen mapping uses the same object-fit:cover math the browser applies, so the ring lands on
  the real pixel on any viewport. Mobile stays text + glass box only.
- **Fonts → Adobe (kit iwq4dnt):** Bodoni URW (display), Adobe Caslon Pro (editorial italic serif),
  P22 Underground (labels). Retired Chicle/Fraunces/Space Grotesk.
