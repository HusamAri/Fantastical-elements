# E01 — Video chain (State 7)

**Method (director):** seamless start→end-frame clips, `start_image` = beat N keyframe, `end_image` =
beat N+1 keyframe → each clip morphs one locked frame into the next, chained into one flow. **Sound ON.**
720p first pass; upscale at State 9. One clip at a time · `get_cost` + LEDGER row + `vqa.py` endpoint QA
+ face-audit each.

**MODEL = Kling v3.0** (`kling3_0`, std, sound on). Chosen after A/B: seedance_2_0 drifts the END frame
(K1→K2 last-vs-K2 ncc −0.10 ✗); **Kling hard-locks BOTH endpoints** (first 0.99 ✓, last 0.965 ✓) and
costs ~10 cr vs 22.5. Gemini Omni Flash has no start/end roles (can't do endpoint morphs). Per clip:
author the LOGICAL motion + camera that carries frame N→N+1 (lesson V8), Kling prompt order
Scene→Characters→Action→Camera→Audio.

## Clips = 16 gaps (start → end)

C15 K7→K5 (flash between) · C16 K5→K5 (settle hold, optional / subtle drift).

## QA (per clip, before accept) — `tools/vqa.py` (OpenCV)
first frame ≈ start keyframe (ncc>0.8), last frame ≈ end keyframe (ncc>0.8), glitch spike_ratio<6,
mid-frames free of unwanted morphing. Endpoint preservation is the join-critical check.

## PHASE 1 — site assembly (State 8, locked 2026-07-09)
The site is **video-scrubbed**: the phase-1 film (C1→C6 concatenated, 30.29s @24fps, K1→K2→K12→
K3→K11→K13→K14) IS the scroll. Scroll scrubs the playhead; the clip morphs are the scene changes
(no cuts/wipes inside the take). Assets in `site/public/hero/`: `phase1.mp4` (source, sound on),
`phase1-scrub.mp4` (H.264 dense-keyframe `-g4`, silent, Safari), `phase1-scrub.webm` (VP9 `-g4`,
silent, Chromium/FF — also the only one this env's headless Chromium can decode for capture).
Re-encodes are LOCAL (imageio-ffmpeg), **zero credits**.

**Pacing (director rule: "tailor how many seconds between those frames, then tailor the length"):**
each frame-pair is a fixed ~5.05s of film, but its DWELL in the scroll is tailored per beat and the
page length = Σ(weights). Calm/reveal beats linger, action beats snap past (EDITING-SOUND §10).
Scroll weights (`src/hero.js` SPANS): title 1.1 · C1 shatter 0.9 · note 0.7 · C2 0.7 ·
**Agustín I 1.5** · C3 action 0.6·0.7 · **Najoua II 1.5** · C5 0.8 · charge 0.6 · C6 throw 0.8 ·
**CTA 1.6**. Σ=12.2 → `#hero-sec` height = 12.2×78 ≈ 950vh. Reveals/CTA get the most scroll; action
the least. Extend for phase 2 by appending clips + SPANS rows (holds for reveals, plays for motion).

  **QA PASS:** first 0.997 ✓, last 0.994 ✓, glitch 3.2 ✓, 1 "frozen" cell = the static FLOOR (false
  positive, not a stuck shard). ✅ **locked.**
- **V12 (camera↔action sync) applied from C4 on** [hypothesis]: bind camera to action ("as he acts the
  camera tracks WITH him"), not a separate move. Sync-feel is a VISUAL check (metrics can't measure it).
- _raw clips tracked by job id, not committed to git (heavy); assembled at picture-lock._
- _method: Kling std, motion-only prompt (V11), action-primary (V10), all-objects-move (V9),
  camera↔action synced (V12), axis held (DIRECTING §C), QA every clip (vqa.py + frozen.py)._
- **PROCESS RULE (corrected 2026-07-09): ONE clip at a time.** Generate one → QA → deliver → WAIT for
  the director's go → next. NO parallel batching (GOVERNANCE §10). C4/C5/C6 were wrongly batched;
  they'll be QA'd one-by-one, and no further clip starts without director approval.
- **C7 K14→K8 (Kling v3.0, std, sound on)** · job `3b762485-5c47-4fdc-a630-e5fef0eec5f8` · 10 cr ·
  connecting logic: the twin glass discs streak forward and SHATTER into black-glass shards (V13 solid
  disc, not flame); the shards sweep R→L as a shard-wipe and the camera whips with them, clearing on
  Husam mid-lunge catching the falling lapis pendant from the disc-gate (K8). Motion-only (V11), all
  objects move (V9), camera↔action synced (V12). Director-approved single generation (2026-07-09).

  burst (~1.1–2.5s) renders fire-heavy and hand briefly fire-wreathed (~2.5s) — inherited from K14's
  locked glass-AND-fire disc; brushes the "flame-cast" look. Delivered to director with accept(A) /
  re-roll-with-suppressed-fire(B) choice.
  **DIRECTOR ACCEPTED (A) 2026-07-09** — C7 locked into the chain as-is.

  connecting logic (continuous combat, NO scene gap): he closes his hand on the lapis pendant → a
  DARK force-bolt streaks in from the right → he reverses momentum and leaps BACKWARD to dodge, cape
  flaring, flicking two SOLID glass discs out (one per hand, thin ember-rim only — V13, no flame-cast);
  dark air detonates into black-glass shards; camera pulls back + pans left with the leap (V12), all
  objects move (V9), attack kept dark/not-amber to stay distinct from the fire flagged on C7.
  Director-approved single generation (2026-07-09).

  ncc=0.929 histCorr=0.994 (excellent); glitch spike_ratio=1.8 (clean, <6); frozen cells=2 →
  (0,3) hovering disc-gate portal + (3,5) standing hooded-attacker silhouette (both meant to be
  low-motion, NOT stalled shards — benign); 5.04s@24fps. Face audit: Husam identity + costume
  consistent across the whole leap, no warp. Fire: incoming attack is DARK with only a small fire
  tip — no plume (cleaner than C7 on V13). Disc reads as a glowing amber ring at his hand rather than
  two distinct solid discs, but faithful to K6's fire-sigil disc keyframe. Delivered to director,
  recommended ACCEPT. **DIRECTOR ACCEPTED 2026-07-09** — C8 locked into the chain.

  connecting logic (continuous combat, NO scene gap): he lands from the dodge → whips his two glass
  discs back to counter → the enemy's DARK strike catches him mid-cast → the discs DETONATE in a
  diegetic ORANGE blast of shattering glass (V13: solid discs destroyed BY the enemy's strike, not
  fire he casts) → he's thrown, torso twisting, one arm up, pained-defiant (K15). Camera shakes +
  pushes in on the hit then settles (V12); all objects move (V9). Director-approved single generation
  (2026-07-09).

  identity + teeth-set defiance consistent through the twist, no warp. Orange disc-detonation READS
  AS ENEMY IMPACT (he recoils/shields, magic broken) — NOT a self fire-cast → V13-safe. Minor: back
  half background lightens to hazy grey vs deep void (inherited from keyframes). Delivered, recommended
  ACCEPT. HELD — no C10 until director's go.
